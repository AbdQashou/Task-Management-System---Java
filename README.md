# Task-Management-System---Java
The task management system should enable users to add tasks, including details such as
name, due date (day, month, year), priority (urgent or normal), and category or label.
To enhance task completion efficiency, the system should facilitate data retrieval, allowing users to display a
list of tasks ordered by their due dates. This feature enables users to prioritize tasks based on their proximity
to their deadlines, enabling focused attention on tasks with closer due dates.
Additionally, users should be able to mark tasks as completed once finished, and the system should provide
the ability to view the history of completed tasks sorted by completion order.
For effective task prioritization, users should be able to retrieve all urgent tasks and initiate work on them
promptly. The system should prioritize urgent tasks starting with the most recently added urgent task.
Furthermore, the system should offer the functionality to sort/show the task list based on category. Tasks
with the same category should appear consecutively, aiding in efficient organization and management of
tasks within specific categories.
